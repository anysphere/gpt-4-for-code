### Control: the AI code editor

We're building [Control](https://control.dev/), an AI code editor.

**Interested in making language models and language servers work together?** If you're an amazing design engineer or awesome systems engineer, or just super interested in the problem of AI for code, please reach out to us at arvid@anysphere.co and sualeh@anysphere.co.

**Want to beta test Control at your company?** We're piloting with a few medium-sized companies (100s of engineers). Our editor is a drop-in replacement for VS Code (works with all of your extensions), and pairs the power of GPT-4 with context about your closed-source codebase. Reach out to us at arvid@anysphere.co and sualeh@anysphere.co.
